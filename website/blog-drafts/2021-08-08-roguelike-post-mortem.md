Indigo was not designed for Roguelikes.

Nonetheless, from time to time I am asked if you could use Indigo to build a roguelike. My answer has always been the same, that technically yes it could be done, but it won't be easy because Roguelikes are typically rendered in ASCII and Indigo is not a console emulator, nor is it's text support well suited for the task.

About a month before this year's annual "RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial" I was asked once again. This time decided it was time to find out first hand whether or not Indigo could handle this type of game, and what it would take to make a roguelike.

This is a brief write up of my experience doing the reddit "RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial".

## Starting at the finish

### Where can I play it?



What was the final thing like? (not a game, code quality, performance, system requirements, prettiness)
Where can people play it?
Finishing the marathon not finishing it well.
Following on work:
- Chunking
- Roguelike lib

## The missing piece

tcod and the starter kit
What is in it?
How does it work?

## The tutorial and the follow along

Well written, nicely laid out, difficult to speed read, very python.
Took me the full time to do it, well paced, would recommend.

The fun bits
The not fun bits

## Lessons Learned

What went well?
The starter kit - code generation - dwarf fortress - prep

What went wrong?
- Underestimated the side of the tutorial

Where did I get lucky?
- Bresenham

What would I do differently next time?
